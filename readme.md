# 🐿️ Squirrel Shock

**Squirrel Shock** is a hobby project that electrifies telecom data — taking frequency allocation tables, ITU regulatory calendars, and global telecom policy news out of dead PDFs and into living, open formats.

## 📡 Project Goals
- Open, structured frequency allocation tables for as many countries as possible
- Calendar of telecom-related events (standards meetings, ITU sessions, etc.)
- Daily newsletter: **Pigeon Post**, with deduplicated global telecom headlines
- GIS/mapping visualizations of CIRAF zones and allocation overlays
- Downloadable datasets and search tools for telecom researchers

> Like a squirrel chewing through a telephone cable, we're here to expose the raw electric truth behind global telecom policy.
